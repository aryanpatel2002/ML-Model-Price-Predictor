# Real Estate Price Predictor

## Overview

The Real Estate Price Predictor is an interactive Python-based machine learning project designed to tackle real estate pricing challenges. It leverages advanced techniques like cross-validation, stratified shuffle split, and Jupyter Notebooks to deliver a reliable and business-oriented price prediction solution.

## Features

* **Interactive Workflow:** Utilizes Jupyter Notebooks for an engaging development experience.
* **Cross-Validation:** Employs cross-validation techniques for robust model performance.
* **Stratified Shuffle Split:** Uses stratified shuffle split for reliable data partitioning.
* **Complete ML Workflow:** Handles data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
